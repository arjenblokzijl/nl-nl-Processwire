# Dutch language pack for ProcessWire

Dutch (nl_NL) language pack for [ProcessWire](http://processwire.com). 

The repository was originally created by Jasper Metselaar ([formmailer](https://github.com/formmailer)). Big thanks Jasper for setting this up way back then. From March 2015 the language pack will be maintained and updated by Arjen Blokzijl for use with the latest stable version of ProcessWire. From the first stable 2.6 release we will tags all releases (both stable and dev). 

This readme will be expanded soon with more details.
